Design a Simple calculator that can support the following operations:

"+"  : plus operation: Example: 5 + 8 := 13
"-"  : minus operation: Example: 5 - 8 := -3

"++" : increment: Example: 3 + 6++ := 10 ; 3 + ++6 := 10
"--" : decrement: Example: 3 + 6-- := 8 ; 3 + --6 := 8

"<<" : LEFTSHIFT operation: Example: 6 << 2 := 24
">>" : RIGHTSHIFT operation: Example: 6 >> 1 := 3
"/"  : DIV operation: Example: 6 / 1 := 6 [note that 6 / 0 := Infinity, you have to handle this.]
"*"  : MUL operation: Example: 6 * 2 := 12
"%"  : MOD operation: Example: 6 % 10 := 6 [only on integer operands, otherwise handle the error]
"**" : DOUBLESTERIK operation: Example: 6 ** 2 := 36

[Note: 1.You also have to handle UNARY MINUS operation!!!!!. Example: 33 - -2:= 35
	   2.You also have to handle UNARY PLUS operation!!!!!. Example: 33 - +2:= 31 ]
